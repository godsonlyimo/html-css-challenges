    introduction: `JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.

    This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.
    
    The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2020.
    
    Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have a very different syntax, semantic, and use.`,
    hello: `A Hello world! example
    JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.
    
    However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example. (Hello world! is the standard for introductory programming examples.)`,
    javascript: `1. JavaScript :
    JavaScript is a lightweight programming language(“scripting language”) and used to make web pages interactive. It can insert dynamic text into HTML. JavaScript is also known as browser’s language. JavaScript(JS) is not similar or related to Java. Both the languages have a C like a syntax and are widely used in client-side Web applications, but there are few similarities only.
    
    2. Java :
    Java is an object-oriented programming language and have virtual machine platform that allows you to create compiled programs that run on nearly every platform. Java promised, “Write Once, Run Anywhere”.`,
    about: `Head over to our Learning Area JavaScript topic if you want to learn JavaScript but have no previous experience of JavaScript or programming. The complete modules available there are as follows: <br>

    <h4>JavaScript first steps</h4>
    Answers some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it do?", along with discussing key JavaScript features such as variables, strings, numbers, and arrays.

    <h4>JavaScript building blocks</h4>
    Continues our coverage of JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.

    <h4>Introducing JavaScript objects</h4>
    The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this module to help you. <br>

    Asynchronous JavaScript <br>
    Discusses asynchronous JavaScript, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations such as fetching resources from a server. <br>

    Client-side web APIs <br>
    Explores what APIs are, and how to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in your development work.`,
    variables: `JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.

    In this example, x, y, and z, are variables:
    From the example above, you can expect:

    x stores the value 5
    y stores the value 6
    z stores the value 11`,
    declaration: `The custom function we are going to build will be called displayMessage(). It will display a custom message box on a web page and will act as a customized replacement for a browser's built-in alert() function. We've seen this before, but let's just refresh our memories. Type the following in your browser's JavaScript console, on any page you like:`,
    scope: `Making decisions in your code — conditionals
    In any programming language, code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is nighttime. In this article we'll explore how conditional structures work in JavaScript.

    Looping code
    Sometimes you need a task done more than once in a row. For example, looking through a list of names. In programming, loops perform this job very well. Here we will look at loop structures in JavaScript.
    Functions — reusable blocks of code
    Another essential concept in coding is functions. Functions allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times. In this article we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define functions, scope, and parameters.

    Build your own function
    With most of the essential theory dealt with previously, this article provides a practical experience. Here you'll get some practice with building up your own custom function. Along the way, we'll also explain some further useful details of dealing with functions.

    Function return values
    The last essential concept you must know about a function is return values. Some functions don't return a significant value after completion, but others do. It's important to understand what their values are, how to make use of them in your code, and how to make your own custom functions return useful values. 

    Introduction to events
    Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired. For example if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to respond to that action by displaying an information box. In this final article we will discuss some important concepts surrounding events, and look at how they work in browsers.`
